var ORDER_CHAOS="Don't draw hasty conclusions.  Just because you couldn't spring the trap with your ten-foot pole this time doesn't mean it won't work next time.  Some animals are heavy sleepers, some not.  Melons are unpredictable, and so on.";
var MAZE_NAVIGATION='"Left-hand rule" and "right-hand rule" work well in these mazes.  In your imagination, place your hand on the wall to your side (left or right, pick one and stick with it), and walk forward.  make whatever turns are necessary to keep that hand on the wall. Eventually, you will explore the entire maze using this technique.  To retrace your steps, do an "about face" and switch hands.\n\n- You cannot go back through an entrance door.  All doors are locked, but there are keyholes only in the exit doors.\n\n- A compass is an unbelievably useful aid to navigation.  Too bad you forgot to bring one.\n\n- Use the "peer" (hollow arrow) buttons to look around at intersections without moving your feet.  Actually spinning around just to see where you are is the easiest way to get lost, because you can forget which way you came.\n\n- Sometimes turning in place doesn\'t change your view.  You have atually turned, but your view in the new direction is coincidentally just the same as the view in the old direction.  If you think this has happened to you, just be very careful in deciding which way you should be going.  This note is just to warn you that it can happen.\n\n- Charcoal can be used to write on the walls.  If you develop a good maze-exploration system using charcoal, write me a note and tell me what it is.\n\n- Don\'t neglect your map.';
var USING_MAP='- Stay at or under speed 5 ("Map Route" on the Speed menu) while exploring unless speed is life-or-death issue.  Getting lost usually wastses more time than the haste gains.\n\n- The enterance to a level is always at the upper-left corner of the map; that\'s the northwest corner.  The exit is always at the southeast (lower-right) corner.  The connection between the exit of one level and the entrance to the next is very mystical.\n\n- To figure out which way to go at an intersection, look at your map, and think like a sports-car rally navigator.  They say things like "left second opp", which means "turn left at your second opportunity". (An "opp" is an opportunity to turn, not a forced turn in a winding corridor.)  On the map you will be able to see that in the direction you want to there is (for example) an immediate left opp, followed by a short section of straight corridor, followed by a forced right turn.  Now put away the map and look at your view in the Pyramid of RA window.  Turn in place until you can see a stretch of corridor with an immediate left opp, followed by a short section of straight corridor, followed by a forced right turn.  That\'s the way you want to go!\n\n- The same trick in reverse can tell you which way you\'re facing.  Look down the corridor and describe what you see: "Right opp, right and left opp, long cul-de-sac".  Then look at the map.  The circle shows where youa re; one of the four directions around the circle should match the secription you just mumbled to yourself.  That\'s which way you\'re facing.\n\n- If your map is destroyed, it\'s usually worthwhile to try to return to the entrance and start a new map.  Unfortunately, this is most important on the lower, larger levels, where it is also most difficult.';
var TIME_MOTION="- The faster you go, the more ground you can cover while you digest food and burn lantern oil.  But generally the benefits of moving slowly outweight the benefits of moving quickly.\n\n- Every object has weight.  Your maximum speed depends on how much weight you are carrying: more weight, less speed.  It is an unfortunate fact of life that sometimes the most valuable objeccts are the heaviest.  Also, sometimes bulk counts as weight: planks and ten-foot poles are not so much heavy as simply cumbersome.\n\n- Your speed doesn't affect the time it takes to turn left, right, or about face; but it still affects things like triggering traps or waking up dozing animals.\n\n- It is your speed when you step onto something that's important; your speed stepping off won't have any effect.\n\n- The \"wristwatch\" buttons always allow the minimum amount of time to pass, no matter what your speed is.  This often means that nothing obvious will happen until you've clicked it several times.";
var FINDING_THINGS="- Most of the things you find in the pyramid were left by earlier expeditions which failed.  Since the better-equipped expeditions got farther into the pyramid before dying, you will find the more useful items only on the deeper levels.\n\n- Several objects can often be found in a single place.  However, only the one heaviest or most attention-getting object in the pile can be seen.  This means that you may have to gather your courage and shuffle around in a sleeping cobra's next; it may be sleeping on the Scarab of RA!\n\n- You won't find any bones.  The animals ate them all. (They are all very hungry, since all they ever get to eat in this barren stone monolith is the occasional explorer.)";
var TRAPS="- Traps are usually hidden, and you won't see them.  In fact, if you're lucky enough not to trigger a hidden trap, you may never know it was there.\n\n- Sometimes you will spot a hidden trap before reaching it.  (It will just appear to your eyes: one instant nothing, the next you can see a trap.)  The slower you move, the better your chance of spotting them.  It is easier to sneak safely past traps you can see.\n\n- Traps can only be tripped once.  After that, they're safe.  You can tell the difference by sight.\n\n- You can't tell one kind of trap from another from a distance.  You can tell by stepping on one, even if you don't trigger it.\n\n- To get past a trap safely, go at your slowest speed.  That's not a guarantee, but it helps the odds: the slower the better.  If you must turn while standing on a trap, stay at the slow speed until you are ready to move off it.\n\n- Stand next to (not on) a trap and poke it with a ten-foot pole.  Sometimes this can trigger the trap - harmlessly, since you're ten feet away.\n\n- Planks are the safest way to get past a trap.  Stand next to (not on) the trap and use the plank to cover it.  You can now walk over the plank just before you step off the trap, if you want to keep it. (This is safe even though it requires good balance to pick up a plank you're standing on.  Fortunately, you are putting yourself through college by performing as a contorionist in a local sideshow, so you will have no problem.)\n\n- Where do you suppose the Egyptians got the poison for their dart traps?";
var ANIMALS_1="- A reminder: the author (that's me) feels kindly toward his creatures, and has not provided any way for you to kill them.  The rest of these hints are less violent ways of dealing with animals.\n\n- Suffer them.  If you're in good health, it may be the easiest way to get rid of an animal.  After attacking you, most animals will feel they've had enough excitement for a while and will run off and hide.  (You will occasionally encounter them later, cowering motionless but awake in some nook.)\n\n- Run away.  This is rarely effective; most animals are very fast (and very agile, they take corners faster than you can).  They are also very patient when following your scent.  However, if it's life or death, you might consider dropping everything (except the key) and running for the exit.\n\n- Stand still (use the \"wristwatch\" buttons a few times).  Sometimes they are just ambling around, checking things out; if you leave them alone, they might just wander off.  Maybe.\n\n- Sometimes being aggressive helps.  Step right into them, as though you were attacking.  They may run off.\n\n- Tiptoe past sleeping animals (slowest speed).  The slower you go, the less the chance the sleeper will wake.  Remember that standing over a sleeping animal and turning also can awaken the critter.\n\n- Just to warn you - animals not only move fast, they move silently.  You will often be attacked from the side or from behind, without warning.  The animal may strike and run off so quickly, you will never see it.";
var ANIMALS_2="Feed animals, by throwing food at them.  They usually don't get anything to eat except explorers; a good meal can put them right to sleep.  Be sure to throw enough; small bribes will be ignored.\n\n- Throw something else at them.  This will sometimes frighten them away.  Heavy things are best.  Be careful what you throw; some things are breakable if they hit the stone floor instead of a nice, soft animal.\n\n- If you are close to an animal, you can try poking it with a ten-foot pole.\n\n- A good CRACK! from a bullwhip may intimidate them.  It may also wake up a nearby sleeper.\n\n- A net will put an animal out of action permanently.  Nets are heavy and sometimes rare, but they are one of the best defenses against animals.\n\n- Another good anti-animal tool is a dart gun.  Both the guns and the darts are quite rare (and the gun is very heavy) but there are valuable.  A well-aimed dart will put an animal to sleep.\n\n- Two or more wakeful animals in the same part of the maze can be a real nightmare, as they get excited and rambunctious.  Wakeful animals never allow each other to pass.  An animal caught between another animal and you may pester you mercilessly until YOU pass IT.";
var LIONS="- Surprisingly, the lioness is probably the least dangerous animal in the pyramid.  She'll maul you a little bit, then run off.  It's probably better to save your rarer equipment for the other creatures.";
var COBRAS="- The thing about cobras is their poisonous bite.  If you are injured in any way, you will generally heal over time.  But the bite of a cobra makes you get ill over time; the two tend to cancel each other out.  If youare bitten more than once, your health will actually decline; the more bites, the faster the decline.\n\n- You will eventually shake off the effects of a bite (if you don't die first) but it takes a while.  Fortunately, there is a cure, which you will occasionally find in bottles.  One slug of cure does for one bite.";
var MONKEYS="- Believe it or not, monkeys are the worst.  The Egyptian monkey is a mischievous kleptomaniac.  He will never harm you; he'll just waste your precious time.  If a monkey steals something you've just got to have (such as the key, or a Sacred Relic) then you have got to try to get it back.\n\n- Monkeys don't want the things they steal; they just enjoy thievery.  They never pick up things that are just lying on the ground.\n\nSo:\n- If you see a monkey coming, drop the things you can't afford to lose, then anything else as time permits.\n\n- If you're sure you can return to where you are now, drop the key and any Sacred Relics you are carrying.  make a note on the map so you don't forget where they are.  Pick them up just before leaving the level.\n\n- A monkey who steals from you will always snatch one object at random from your inventory. (He hasn't time to pick and choose.)  Filling your pack with light, unimportant things helps.  So does keeping one ounce of gold or food when you ame a deposit or eat.\n\n- Monkeys like glittery things.  Try throwing gold to distract a monkey before she steals form you.  Be generous; small bribes will be sneered at.";
var CHASING_MONKEYS="- If a monkey steals something you've got to get back, chase her.  Drop everything you're carrying first, for speed and to keep the monkey from stealing anything else.  Go as fast as you can and try to keep the monkey in sight.  Use the \"peek\" buttons at intersections to save time in figuring out which way the monkey went.\n\n- Sometimes (rarely) a monkey will simply drop everything she's carrying.  Pick it all up and abandon the chase.\n\n- Eventually the fleeing monkey will hole up in a cul-de-sac.  Now you can try to get your property back, as explained in the next few notes.\n\n- If you step on a wakeful monkey, the monkey may just run off, or he may steal something else (if you're carrying anything), or he may be startled into dropping something he's carrying.  This last is what you want to happen.  Keep chasing the monkey; every time you catch up to him there's a chance he'll drop what you want.\n\n- If a monkey is in a cul-de-sac, turn around before you attack.  Step backwards into the monkey.  This way, if the monkey doesn't drop what you want, you don't waste time turning around to continue the chase.\n\n- Be patient.  Sometimes it takes a long time to startle a monkey into dropping what you want.";
var GUARDIANS="The Guardians of the Sacred Scarab of RA are the greatest dangers in the Pyramid.  They will seek and destroy any who dare defile the Scarab with a mortal's touch.  But these tips should help:\n\n- The Guardians are easy to recognize.  They're the ones who look as if their nurses have forgotten about them.\n\n- They are slow, but relentless.\n\n- There is only one Guardian on each level.  Be watchful; they appear at unpredictable times, and from unpredictable directions.  Look behind you!\n\n- Though the Scarab brings their curse, it is also your only defense.  It can be a weapon against them, if you can figure out how to use it.\n\n- The Guardians, unlike the animals, can be destroyed.
