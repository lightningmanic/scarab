===--- ABOUT ---===
The game "Scarab of RA" was originally a shareware application for
the Macintosh OS 6/7.  It was written by a fellow named Rick Holzgrafe.

This is a step-motion adventure game re-creation of this old Mac game, 
written entirely in HTML5/JavaScript.  Because of this, it is playable
on any modern computer (and some mobile devices!).

All images, text, and code has been hand-written by me - nothing but
the idea has been used from the original game.  However, if you have
ever played the original, you will quickly learn that the "look-and-feel"
of this version is quite similar, bringing back many fun memories.



===--- THE GAME ---===
You start off as an undergrad in Archeology, and a recent discovery
has led you into a solo expedition of exploring the Temple of RA.
Much like any traditional Egyptian pyramid, you start at the top-most
level: a 3 x 3 maze.  Each level increases these dimensions by 1 (4 x 4,
5 x 5, and so on).  In order to move on to the next level, you must
find the key to the exit door, then find the exit.  Using the key
while facing the exit door will start you on the next level!

There are many perils and treasures to be found within the great
Temple of RA.  Three of which must be recovered in order to beat
the game.  These are, of course, the three ancient artifacts of RA:
the crown of RA, the staff of RA, and the scarab of RA.  Other
treasures may help aid you in your adventure, some more useful than
others.  But keep a wary eye out for various inhabitants of the great
Temple!
